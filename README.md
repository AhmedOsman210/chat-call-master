# ChatCall App

A simple Node.js application for managing chat calls with database integration. This app allows users to make calls, chat, and manage call-related data through a web server.

## Features
- User authentication
- Real-time chat and call functionality
- Integration with a database (configured via environment variables)
- Responsive user interface

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- A database (configured with the `DATABASE` environment variable)

## Installation

Follow these steps to get your local copy of the project up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatCall-master.git
cd chatCall-master
2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required Node.js packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
3. Set Up Environment Variables
You need to configure the necessary environment variables, especially the DATABASE variable. You can either set them directly in your terminal session or create a .env file at the root of your project.

Setting Environment Variables:
On Windows (Command Prompt):

bash
Copy
Edit
set DATABASE=your_database_connection_string
On Linux/macOS (Terminal):

bash
Copy
Edit
export DATABASE=your_database_connection_string
If you're using a .env file, create the file at the root of your project and add the following:

ini
Copy
Edit
DATABASE=your_database_connection_string
Make sure to replace your_database_connection_string with the actual connection string for your database.

4. Run the App
After installing the dependencies and configuring the environment variables, you can start the app by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
node app.js
The app will start and be accessible at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if configured differently).

Usage
Once the app is running, you can access it via your browser. The app supports the following features:

User Authentication: Users can log in to the system and access their chats and calls.
Chat Interface: Users can send and receive messages in real-time.
Call Functionality: Make and receive calls directly from the app.
Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend server for handling API requests and database operations.
Express.js: Web framework used to build the server.
Socket.io: Real-time communication for chat functionality.
MongoDB (or your chosen database): Database for storing user data, messages, and call logs.
dotenv: To load environment variables from the .env file.
Troubleshooting
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace'): If you encounter this error, ensure that you have correctly set the DATABASE environment variable. You may also want to check if the .env file is being loaded correctly with the dotenv package.
